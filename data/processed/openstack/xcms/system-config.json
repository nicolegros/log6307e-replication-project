        "commit_message": "Add borg-backup roles\n\nThis adds roles to implement backup with borg [1].\n\nOur current tool \"bup\" has no Python 3 support and is not packaged for\nUbuntu Focal.  This means it is effectively end-of-life.  borg fits\nour model of servers backing themselves up to a central location, is\nwell documented and seems well supported.  It also has the clarkb seal\nof approval :)\n\nAs mentioned, borg works in the same manner as bup by doing an\nefficient back up over ssh to a remote server.  The core of these\nroles are the same as the bup based ones; in terms of creating a\nseparate user for each host and deploying keys and ssh config.\n\nThis chooses to install borg in a virtualenv on /opt.  This was chosen\nfor a number of reasons; firstly reading the history of borg there\nhave been incompatible updates (although they provide a tool to update\nrepository formats); it seems important that we both pin the version\nwe are using and keep clients and server in sync.  Since we have a\nhetrogenous distribution collection we don't want to rely on the\npackaged tools which may differ.  I don't feel like this is a great\napplication for a container; we actually don't want it that isolated\nfrom the base system because it's goal is to read and copy it offsite\nwith as little chance of things going wrong as possible.\n\nBorg has a lot of support for encrypting the data at rest in various\nways.  However, that introduces the possibility we could lose both the\nkey and the backup data.  Really the only thing stopping this is key\nmanagement, and if we want to go down this path we can do it as a\nfollow-on.\n\nThe remote end server is configured via ssh command rules to run in\nappend-only mode.  This means a misbehaving client can't delete its\nold backups.  In theory we can prune backups on the server side --\nsomething we could not do with bup.  The documentation has been\nupdated but is vague on this part; I think we should get some hosts in\noperation, see how the de-duplication is working out and then decide\nhow we want to mange things long term.\n\nTesting is added; a focal and bionic host both run a full backup of\nthemselves to the backup server.  Pretty cool, the logs are in\n/var/log/borg-backup-<host>.log.\n\nNo hosts are currently in the borg groups, so this can be applied\nwithout affecting production.  I'd suggest the next steps are to bring\nup a borg-based backup server and put a few hosts into this.  After\nrunning for a while, we can add all hosts, and then deprecate the\ncurrent bup-based backup server in vexxhost and replace that with a\nborg-based one; giving us dual offsite backups.\n\n[1] https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\nChange-Id: I2a125f2fac11d8e3a3279eb7fa7adb33a3acaa4e\n",

It thus\ngets matches the loopback entry in /etc/hosts and passes along a rule\nfor 127.0.1.1 or similar.  The ipv6 hostname is not in /etc/hosts so\nthis works there.\n\nWhat we really want the dns_<a|aaaa> filters to do is lookup the\naddress in DNS, rather than the local resolver.  Without wanting to\nget involved in new libraries, etc. the simplest option seems to be to\nuse the well-known 'host' tool.

Shouldn't affect\n      us.\n  * Make issue and code search support camel case for Bleve (#22829)\n    * We don't rely on code search in gitea yet, but this seems like a\n      good addition.\n  * Repositories: by default disable all units except code and pulls on forks (#22541)\n    * We don't allow forks so this shouldn't affect us.\n  * Support template for merge message description (#22248)\n    * We don't do merging via gitea so this shouldn't affect us.\n  * Remove ONLY_SHOW_RELEVANT_REPOS setting (#21962)\n    * We don't set this flag in our app.ini config file.\n  * Implement actions (#21937)\n    * They are disabled by default, but I've explicitly disabled them as\n      we use Zuul.\n  * Remove deprecated DSA host key from Docker Container (#21522)\n    * Our installatins were all created prior to this update which\n      generated DSA keys. We can go and manually clean them up with\n      gitea disabled if we like.\n  * Improve valid user name check (#20136)\n    * As long as our CI job is able to create the necessary accounts we\n      should be fine.\n\n* 1.19.1\n  * Rename actions unit to repo.actions and add docs for it (#23733) (#23881)\n    * app.ini.j2 updated to use repo.actions to disable the repo unit.\n\n* 1.19.2\n  * No breaking changes listed.\n\n* 1.19.3\n  * No breaking changes listed.\n\nIn addition to the breaking changes upstream has updated to golang 1.20\nand nodejs 18. We update our image to match.\n\nIn 1.19.0 and 1.19.1 org listing required authentication which was a new\nchange/regression in [0] gitea. I have updated the logo update role to\ndrop authentication details to make it clear this API should be publicly\naccessible. In earlier patchsets I was forcing basic auth due to another\nbug [1] which is not correct as we expect this API to be public.\nUpdating the role this way makes that more clear.\n\nFinally the usual template updates are applied to keep our forked\ntemplates in line with upstream. There were no template changes between\n1.19.0, 1.19.1, 1.19.2, and 1.19.3 according to git diff.\n\n[0] https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/24159\n[1] https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/24160\n\nChange-Id: I5570deaf505a27c8c90c58896de990a4d2d44530\n",

Similar entries should be added for\nreview.openstack.org before going into production.\n\n* modules/gerrit/manifests/init.pp(gerrit): Add contactstore,\ncontactstore_appsec and contactstore_url variables needed by the\ngerrit.config.erb template, and contactstore_pubkey needed by the\ncontact_information.pub.erb template. Add a conditional block so that if\ncontactstore is enabled it installs the libbcpg-java package which\nBouncy Castle needs for OpenPGP operations, links the bcpg.jar into\nGerrit's lib directory, and builds contact_information.pub from the\ncontact_information.pub.erb template.\n\n* modules/gerrit/templates/contact_information.pub.erb: New template\nwhich is effectively an empty file waiting to be filled with the\ncontents of the contactstore_pubkey variable. The\ngerrit_contact_information.pub file built from it gets used to encrypt\ncontact information filed by users in such a way that it can only be\ndecrypted by the private key held by the Foundation.\n\n* modules/gerrit/templates/gerrit.config.erb(contactstore): New section,\nimplemented conditionally for safety. Once enabled, if the\ncontactstore_appsec and contactstore_url are unset then Gerrit will\nrefuse to start. If the system referred to by contactstore_url is\nunresponsive or contactstore_appsec does not contain the shared secret\nit's expecting, contributors will be unable to file initial or updated\ncontact information through Gerrit's WebUI.\n\n* modules/openstack_project/files/gerrit/cla.html: A stripped-down HTML\ncopy of http://wiki.openstack.org/CLA retaining all the original\nwording. This will probably need updating by OpenStack Foundation staff.\n\n* modules/openstack_project/manifests/gerrit.pp\n(openstack_project::gerrit): Add contactstore, contactstore_appsec,\ncontactstore_pubkey and contactstore_url variables to pass back into the\ngerrit module. Also define the cla_description, cla_file, cla_id and\ncla_name variables which get used in the gerrit_set_agreements.sh.erb\ntemplate. Add an entry to install the cla.html file.\n\n* modules/openstack_project/manifests/review_dev.pp\n(openstack_project::review_dev): Add the contactstore_appsec and\ncontactstore_pubkey variables so they can be filled in by hiera.\nOverride the war to pull in the g69c8fa6 test build which has the\naforementioned CLA bits restored. Turn on contactstore and set\ncontactstore_url to point to an existing test CGI on the Internet until\nthe Foundation has theirs ready. Pass contactstore_appsec and\ncontactstore_pubkey through up into gerrit.pp. Add an entry for the\nset_agreements.sh script built from the gerrit_set_agreements.sh.erb\ntemplate and then execute it to add the new CLA to Gerrit's DB and mark\nthe old one expired. Similar changes should be made in review.pp before\ngoing into production.\n\n* modules/openstack_project/templates/gerrit_set_agreements.sh.erb: New\ntemplate used to build a set_agreements.sh script which checks Gerrit's\ndatabase and, if necessary, expires the old Echosign CLA and adds the\nnew local CLA. These conditions are checked and associated operations\nperformed independently, so subsequent runs become a no-op.\nPost-migration, this can probably be neutered further and kept around\nfor pushing future CLA modifications into the database when needed.\n\nChange-Id: Ib7136fef23dbd5602955649b33a57bc8d7106026\nReviewed-on: https://review.openstack.org/13058\nReviewed-by: Monty Taylor <mordred@inaugust.com>\nReviewed-by: Clark Boylan <clark.boylan@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: James E.

We've talked about leaving\ncodesearch up to gitea, but it's not quite there yet.  There seems to\nbe no point working on the puppet now.\n\nThis builds a container than runs houndd.  It's an opendev specific\ncontainer; the config is pulled from project-config directly.\n\nThere's some custom scripts that drive things.  Some points for\nreviewers:\n\n - update-hound-config.sh uses \"create-hound-config\" (which is in\n   jeepyb for historical reasons) to generate the config file.  It\n   grabs the latest projects.yaml from project-config and exits with a\n   return code to indicate if things changed.\n\n - when the container starts, it runs update-hound-config.sh to\n   populate the initial config.  There is a testing environment flag\n   and small config so it doesn't have to clone the entire opendev for\n   functional testing.\n\n - it runs under supervisord so we can restart the daemon when\n   projects are updated.  Unlike earlier versions that didn't start\n   listening till indexing was done, this version now puts up a \"Hound\n   is not ready yet\" message when while it is working; so we can drop\n   all the magic we were doing to probe if hound is listening via\n   netstat and making Apache redirect to a status page.\n\n - resync-hound.sh is run from an external cron job daily, and does\n   this update and restart check.  Since it only reloads if changes\n   are made, this should be relatively rare anyway.\n\n - There is a PR to monitor the config file\n   (https://github.com/hound-search/hound/pull/357) which would mean\n   the restart is unnecessary.  This would be good in the near and we\n   could remove the cron job.\n\n - playbooks/roles/codesearch is unexciting and deploys the container,\n   certificates and an apache proxy back to localhost:6080 where hound\n   is listening.\n\nI've combined removal of the old puppet bits here as the \"-codesearch\"\nnamespace was already being used.\n\nChange-Id: I8c773b5ea6b87e8f7dfd8db2556626f7b2500473\n",

This is inspired by a few things\n\n - since migration to NoteDB, there is only one table left where\n   Gerrit records what files have been reviewed for a change.  This\n   logically scales with the number of reviews users are doing.\n   Pulling the stats on this, we can see since the NoteDB upgrade this\n   went from a very busy database (~300 queries/70 commits per second)\n   to barely registering one hit per second :\n   https://imgur.com/a/QGJV7Fw\n\n   Thus separating the db to an external host for performance reasons\n   is not a large concern any more.\n\n - emperically we've done a bad job in keeping the existing hosted db\n   up-to-date; it's still running mysql 5.1 and we have been hit by\n   bugs such as the one referenced in-line which silently drops\n   backups.\n\n - The other gerrit option is to use an on-disk H2 database.  This is\n   certainly an option, however you need special tools to interact\n   with it for migration, etc. and it's not safe to backup from files\n   on disk (as opposed to mysqldump).  Upstream advice is unclear, and\n   varies between H2 being a performance bottleneck to this being\n   ephemeral data that users don't care about.  We know how to admin\n   mariadb/mysql and this allows us to migrate and backup data, so\n   seems like the best choice.\n\n - we have a pressing need to update the server to a new operating\n   system.  Running the db alongside the gerrit instance minimises\n   fiddling we have to do manging connections to and migrating the\n   hosted db systems.\n\n - related to that, we are tending towards more provider independence\n   for control-plane servers.  A hosted database product is not always\n   provided, so this gives us more flexibility in moving things\n   around.\n\n - the main concern here is memory usage.  \"docker stats\" reports a\n   quiescent container, freshly started on a 8GB host:\n\n    gerrit-compose_mariadb_1  67.32MiB\n\n   After loading a copy of the production table, and then dumping it\n   back to a file the same container reports:\n\n    gerrit-compose_mariadb_1  462.6MiB\n\nThe existing remote mysql configuration path remains mostly the same.\nWe move the gerrit startup into a script rather than a CMD so we can\ncall it after a \"wait for db\" script in the mariadb_container case\n(this is the reccommeded way to enforce ordering [1]).\n\nBackups of the local container need different dump commands; backups\nare relocated to a new file and updated.\n\nTesting is converted to use this rather than a local H2 database.\n\n[1] https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/\n\nChange-Id: Iec981ef3c2e38889f91e9759e66295dbfb499c2e\n",

This meant it was looking for libraries installed in\nthe system-python path (dist-packages) not the pip/upstream path\n(site-packages).  This was reported and upstream are currently\nevaluating a fix for that [1]\n\nIn the mean time, we merged Ib3dfda3df69e7ab359b96cd1865e47c7e1e8047b\nwhich also avoids this problem by not including the \"unstable\" distro\nin the image.  Since the system-python 3.11 packages were coming from\n\"unstable\", this avoids the \"same version\" of the problem; the\nupstream-python won't pick up the older version's libpython.so.\n\nAfter this change the image is actually broken with this, because it\ndirects the system-python (now 3.9 since the change) to the 3.11\nlibraries, which obviously doesn't work.  Thus revert this now.\n\n[1] https://github.com/docker-library/python/pull/785\n\nChange-Id: I814d5920d8203bcb9f60b9769164c3d2a925f526\n",

For versioning, our convention is to get info\nfrom SCM to set the project build versions.  For deployments\nto remote repositories we prefer to use curl instead of mvn deploy\ndue to maven security vulnerabilities.  Our python builds\nhave already been setup to set package versions from SCM and\ndeploy to pypi using curl so this commit is to make\nmaven versioning and deployments similiar our python\nversioning and deployment workflow.\n\nThis commit does the following:\n\nSetup a project version string as an environement variable\nso we can pass it to maven builds. The version string is\nretrieved from information in git.  This makes the build versioning\nworkflow similar to how we build python packages.\n\n  This setup expects a variable called '$project-version' in\n  the root 'version' element (i.e. <version>${project-version}</version>)\n  of the maven project's pom.xml file.\n\n  For general (throw away CI) builds we do the following:\n    1. generate a package 'myplugin.hpi' with version '1.3.0.4.a0bc21f'\n       in the MANIFEST.MF file.  The '4' is the number of commits since\n       last tag.\n    2. publish 'myplugin-1.3.0.4.a0bc21f.hpi' to tarballs.o.o\n\n  For release builds we do the following:\n    1. generate a package 'myplugin.hpi' with version '1.3.1'\n     in the MANIFEST.MF file.\n    2. publish 'myplugin-1.3.1.hpi' to tarballs.o.o\n    3. publish 'myplugin-1.3.1.hpi' to repo.jenkins-ci.org\n\nPasses the jenkins credentials from hiera to the pypi slave so\nwe can use it to deploy released plugins to repo.jenkins-ci.org\n\nCreates a generic jenkinsci-upload job that will deploy\nreleased jenkins plugin artifacts to a remote repository with\nuser credentials from hiera.

        "commit_message": "AFS: Allow for remote vos release with localauth\n\nWe constantly have problems with various timeouts on the release of\nour mirror volumes creating locked volumes or stuck transactions; this\nthen requires significant manual intervention.  This has been\ndiscussed multiple times, but this short exchange from #openafs\nprobably sums it up best:\n\n Sep 11 13:32:35 <auristor> The timeout problem is due to the fact\n  that UV_ReleaseVolume performs multiple RPCs.  vos acquires a token\n  from the cache manager when it starts.  it has no method of acquiring\n  a new token if it expired during an RPC.  Therefore, if the token did\n  expire the remaining RPCs are performed unauthenticated.  Without\n  appropriate permissions the cleanup of the volservers, writing the\n  updating VL entry will fail.\n\n Sep 11 13:33:59 <auristor> A frequent solution is to deploy a remctld\n  service which has access to issue vos commands as -localauth and then\n  use remctld ACLs to restrict the identities of the processes that are\n  permitted to request the volume release.\n\n Sep 11 14:37:28 <kaduk> Yeah, the -localauth tokens are pretty key\n for long-running stuff, at the moment.\n\nIndeed remctl [1] has been written to be the kerberos-based remote\ncontrol AFS wrapper.  However, it is complex to setup, uses a lot of\nPerl and it is unlikely to be familiar to very many people (making the\nfootprint of people who can help us admin it low).  Getting it wrong\nseems to be a pretty good vector for remote exploits.  It does not\nseem to be a good fit.\n\nHowever, we can take a simpler approach.  We can use Ansible to setup\nour afs server to allow a particular key to run a release script that\nwraps the \"vos release -localauth\" for us.  With this in place, we can\nupdate the scripts that run on mirror-update to ssh remotely and call\nthis, rather than call \"vos release\" directly.\n\nThis implements this basic support for the remote script.  A new key\nwill be generated on mirror-update.opendev.org and it will be allowed\nto run the vos_release.sh script remotely; which filters the command\nto just do \"vos release -localauth\".\n\nAfter we have tested this, we can start using it in scripts.  I think\ntime will tell if we need locking or other features; this seems like\nthe KISS place to start.\n\n[1] https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/remctl/remctl.html\n\nChange-Id: I6c96f89c6f113362e6085febca70d58176f678e7\n",

We\n  don't use this anywhere as far as I can tell.\n* Refactor git module, make Gitea use internal git config (#19732)\n  In the gitea container /data/git/.gitconfig is present but we don't\n  appear to manage this in system-config. I think that means this\n  change is a noop for us as gitea will move its managed .gitconfig\n  from /data/git/.gitconfig to /data/git/repositories/.gitconfig.\n  I expect the contents to be the same since gitea must be managing\n  the file old content today.\n* Remove RequireHighlightJS field, update plantuml example. (#19615)\n  This was a flag that toggled syntax highlighting on and off as best\n  as I can tell. The default is to just have it turned on and we don't\n  check the flag in any of our templates.\n* Increase minimal required git version to 2.0 (#19577)\n  Debian Bullseye ships with 2.30.2-1.\n* Add a directory prefix gitea-src-VERSION to release-tar-file (#19396)\n  They were tarbombing people and their tarballs extracted into the\n  current dir. They now no longer do that. We build from git so this\n  doesn't affect us.\n* Use \"main\" as default branch name (#19354)\n  We explicitly set the default branch name to master for both gitea and\n  gerrit. This should be a noop for us. Testing has been added to check\n  this.\n  https://opendev.org/opendev/system-config/src/branch/master/playbooks/roles/gitea-git-repos/library/gitea_create_repos.py#L129-L132\n  https://opendev.org/opendev/jeepyb/src/branch/master/jeepyb/cmd/manage_projects.py#L488\n* Make cron task no notice on success (#19221)\n  I'm not aware of us relying on any cron tasks or any cron task\n  notifications.\n* Add pam account authorization check (#19040)\n  We don't integrate with pam so the change in behavior to check\n  authorization does not affect us.\n* Show messages for users if the ROOT_URL is wrong, show JavaScript errors (#18971)\n  This message shows up in CI because ROOT_URL is https://opendev.org\n  but we access gitea in testing via localhost. I don't think this\n  is worth fixing. Its a good reminder that the instance is a test\n  instance.\n* Refactor mirror code & fix StartToMirror (#18904)\n  We don't mirror repos with gitea. Should be a noop for us.\n* Remove deprecated SSH ciphers from default (#18697)\n  hmac-sha1-96, diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, and arcfour{128,256} are\n  removed. The only ssh user is gerrit's replication. MINA should\n  be able to support more modern ciphers and be fine.\n* Add the possibility to allow the user to have a favicon which differs from the main logo (#18542)\n  Previously, logo.svg was used as the favicon.svg and gitea only fell\n  back to favicon.png if the browser couldn't so the .svg. But now they\n  want to support users having different logo.svg and favicon.svg. This\n  necessitates explicitly adding a favicon.svg. Something we already do.\n  Details at https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/18542\n* Update reserved usernames list (#18438)\n  This shouldn't be a problem for us as we don't have regular users and\n  gerrit is not a reserved name.\n* Support custom ACME provider (#18340)\n  We run ACME with LE out of band. This doesn't affect us.\n* Change initial TrustModel to committer (#18335)\n  This changes the signed commits trust model from collaborator\n  to committer. THis won't affect us as we aren't maintaining trusted\n  keys. But basically this now shows if the signed commit by the\n  committer matches the committer's key.\n* Update HTTP status codes (#18063)\n  This changed redirect HTTP codes from 302 to 307. Shouldn't\n  affect us.\n* Upgrade Alpine from 3.13 to 3.15 (#18050)\n  We build on Debian and not alpine. The alpine nodejs version did\n  change from 14 to 16 in this change and we've updated to match.\n* Restrict email address validation (#17688)\n  If we had real users this may pose a problem as they are limiting\n  the set of emails gitea would accept to a smaller set than they\n  accepted before. Also fewer than actually allowed by email. But\n  we don't have real users so this should be fine.\n* Refactor Router Logger (#17308)\n  This streamlines and improves the log format of some of the gitea\n  logs. We aren't automatically processing these logs today so this\n  shouldn't have a major impact on us.\n\nAdditionally this release adds a new git.HOME_PATH setting to set the\nlocation for writing out git configs and potential gnupg configs. We\nshould be fine to let gitea write this content out to the default path,\nbut there is potential for this to impact our ssh daemon.\n\nChanges made include:\n\n * Minimal updates to web templates to match 1.17\n * Updating nodejs to v16 as v14 failed to build gitea\n * Disabling the new enabled by default \"packages\" feature\n * New test to check repos have a master branch by default instead of\n   Gitea's new default of main.\n\nChange-Id: I88105eccd118e3daca72f0b86a6b351c35e37413\n",

I think this is worthwhile considering\nthese images don't update often so we should only ever have one extra\nold set on the node. If others don't care for this feel free to modify\nthe change to remove this edit.\n\nChange-Id: I84e89e461ae8957c553c8f3d1b537af622a824b4\n",

Eventually, we should be able to move all OpenStack\nspecific builders, publishers, etc outside of the base modules; instead\nwe would just register an 'openstack_pep8' builder in a module of our own\nthat the job filler would know to invoke.\n\nThe API for modules is slightly changed, adding a root_xml method to handle\nthe different project types, a handle_data method for modules that want\nto modify the yaml data structure before any XML is generated, and a data\nparameter is added to the generate_xml method.  Ideally, we will migrate\nthose modules that count on having a centrally stored data object to using\nthe one passed into this method to allow maximum flexibility.  I also\nenvision some project-level yaml attributes to be moved closer to the\nhandlers that use them.\n\nThis change does inadvertently alter the XML produced.  Here is the result\nof test.sh:  http://paste.openstack.org/show/18585/\n\nIn all cases, those are inconsistencies in the YAML that are corrected\nby this change.  Some jobs included an empty triggers vector (due to\nmodule trigger_none) while others did not, so there was no way to satisfy\nboth behaviors.  The added postbuilder section in the gerrit maven job is\nthere because the job specified postbuilders, but did not include the\npostbuilder module.  I believe the resulting XML is more desirable.\n\nChange-Id: Ib38222e6bfc9d5b55aa497669d7023c7aaf4b7bc\n",

It uses the acme.sh tool (via the\n   driver) to request the certificates from letsencrypt.  It populates\n   a global Ansible variable with the authentication TXT records\n   required.\n\n   If the certificate exists on the host and is not within the renewal\n   period, it should do nothing.\n\n3) letsencrypt-install-txt-record\n\n   This role runs on the adns server.  It installs the TXT records\n   generated in step 2 to the acme.opendev.org domain and then\n   refreshes the server.  Hosts wanting certificates will have\n   pre-provisioned CNAME records for _acme-challenge.host.opendev.org\n   pointing to acme.opendev.org.\n\n4) letsencrypt-create-certs\n\n   This role runs on each host, reading the same variable as in step\n   2.

I reason that this is a reasonable number based on the\nMaxRequestWorkers documentation claiming the default is 400 for\nmpm_worker[1]:\n\n   For threaded and hybrid servers (e.g. event or worker)\n   MaxRequestWorkers restricts the total number of threads that will be\n   available to serve clients. For hybrid MPMs the default value is 16\n   (ServerLimit) multiplied by the value of 25 (ThreadsPerChild).\n   Therefore, to increase MaxRequestWorkers to a value that requires\n   more than 16 processes, you must also raise ServerLimit.\n\nIf 400 is too few, we can increase it but we must also increase\nServerLimit, which requires not just an apache restart but a full stop\nand start[2]:\n\n  Any attempts to change this directive during a restart will be ignored\n\n[1] https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mpm_common.html#maxrequestworkers\n[2] https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mpm_common.html#serverlimit\n\nChange-Id: Iab0012e02506f5b7212fe273cfe673f95279d440\n",

This is then extended with the\nletsencrypt_certcheck_additional_domains value that covers any hosts\nusing certificates not provisioned by letsencrypt using this\nmechanism.\n\nThese additional domains are pre-populated from the openstack.org\ndomains in the extant check file, minus those openstack.org domain\ncertificates we are generating via letsencrypt (see\nletsencrypt-create-certs/handlers/main.yaml).

Git is updated from 2.30.2-1+deb11u2\nto 2.39.2-1.1. In general git has been very good about maintaining\ncompatibility, but there is some risk of a behavior change impacting us.\n\nSecond is openssh-server. In particular we upgrade from 8.4p1-5+deb11u1\nto 9.2p1-2 which crosses the 8.8 release threshold. 8.8 changed how RSA\nkeys are handled. Now by default only RSA + SHA2 is negotiated by\ndefault and RSA + SHA1 is not allowed. Gerrit currently uses RSA keys\nfor replication. This should all be fine because MINA added support for\nnegotiating RSA + SHA2 as both a client and server in version prior to\nthat running in Gerrit 3.7, but there is still some risk this will\nbreak.\n\nWe can test this with held nodes, or we can assume it will work given\nthe fixes in MINA. Then if it breaks we can switched to ed25519 keys or\nupdate config to openssh to reenable SHA1 or we can revert to bullseye.\n\nNote, we make a small update to the image to set `ENV USER git` in both\nthe web and ssh iamges as the ssh image uses this env var to dynamically\nset sshd_config's AllowUsers value. We weren't setting this value\npreviously which older sshd seems to ignore. Bookworm sshd gets angry\nabout this directly being set without a value in its config.\n\nChange-Id: I5a923798e90be4dcd9486a97014180ed1790fab1\n",

However,\nI am unable to test federation with openstackid due its inability to\nconfigure an oauth app at \"localhost\".  Therefore, we will need an\nactual deployed system to test it.  This should allow us to do so.\n\nIt will also allow use to connect realms to the newly available\nZuul admin api on opendev.\n\nIt should be possible to configure the realm the way we want, then\nexport its configuration into a JSON file and then have our playbooks\nor the docker-compose file import it.  That would allow us to drive\nchange to the configuration of the system through code review.  Because\nof the above limitation with openstackid, I think we should regard the\ncurrent implementation as experimental.  Once we have a realm\nconfiguration that we like (which we will create using the GUI), we\ncan chose to either continue to maintain the config with the GUI and\nappropriate file backups, or switch to a gitops model based on an\nexport.\n\nMy understanding is that all the data (realms configuration and session)\nare kept in an H2 database.  This is probably sufficient for now and even\nproduction use with Zuul, but we should probably switch to mariadb before\nany heavy (eg gerrit, etc) production use.\n\nThis is a partial implementation of https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-specs/latest/specs/central-auth.html\n\nWe can re-deploy with a new domain when it exists.\n\nChange-Id: I2e069b1b220dbd3e0a5754ac094c2b296c141753\nCo-Authored-By: Matthieu Huin <mhuin@redhat.com>\n",

        "commit_message": "Update to Gitea 1.20\n\nThe 1.20 release is here. Upgrade to this version.\n\nThings we change:\n * Nodejs is updated to v20 to match the alpine 3.18 package version\n   that gitea switched to.\n * Templates are updated to match upstream 1.20 templates.\n * We drop the deprecated LFS_CONTENT_PATH from our server config and\n   add an equivalent [lfs] config section.\n * Normalize app.ini content so that gitea won't write it back out to\n   disk which fails due to permissions (and we don't want it overriding\n   our configs anyway). For this we need to add WORK_PATH,\n   oauth2.JWT_SECRET, and normliazing spacing and quoting for entries.\n * Set JWT_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE explicitly to be located at\n   /data/gitea/jwt/private.pem otherwise gitea attempts to create the\n   jwt/ directory somewhere it doesn't have permissions to (I think /)\n   and won't be persisted across containers.\n * Replace log.ENABLE_ACCESS_LOG with log.logger.access.MODE = file as\n   log.ENABLE_ACCESS_LOG is deprecated and doesn't appear to work\n   anymore. This appears to be a documentation issue or they deprecated\n   and removed things more quickly than originaly anticipated.\n * Add log.ACCESS_LOG_TEMPLATE to readd source port info to the access\n   logs.\n * Add a templates/custom/header.tmpl file to set theme-color as the\n   config item for this has been removed.\n\nThe 1.20.0 changelog [0] lists a number of breaking changes. I have\ntried to capture there here as well as potential impacts to us:\n\n * Fix WORK_DIR for docker (root) image (#25738) (#25811)\n   * We set APP_DATA_PATH to /data/gitea in our app.ini config which\n     means we aren't relying on the inferred value from WORK_DIR. I\n     think this isolates us from this chnage. But we can check for any\n     content in /app/gitea on our running containers to be sure.\n     Note we hardcode WORK_PATH to /data/gitea because gitea attempts to\n     write this back to our config file otherwise as a result of this\n     change.\n * Restrict [actions].DEFAULT_ACTIONS_URL to only github or self (#25581) (#25604)\n   * We disable actions. This shouldn't affect us.\n * Refactor path & config system (#25330) (#25416)\n   * This is related to the first breaking changes. Basically we need\n     to check our use of WORK_PATH and determine if we need to hardcode\n     it to something. Probably a good idea given how they keep changing\n     this on us...\n * Fix all possible setting error related storages and added some tests (#23911) (#25244)\n   * We don't use storage configs. This shouldn't affect us.\n * Use a separate admin page to show global stats, remove actions stat (#25062)\n   * The breaking change only affects the use of Prometheus which we\n     don't have yet.\n * Remove the service worker (#25010)\n   * Is listed as a breaking change for UI cleanup that we don't need to\n     cleanup. (ui.USE_SERVICE_WORKER can be removed).\n * Remove meta tags theme-color and default-theme (#24960)\n   * https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/24960\n   * Addressed by adding a custome templates/custom/header.tmpl file\n     that sets this meta tag to the existing value. Note this only\n     affects mobile clients so needs to be double checked via a mobile\n     device.\n * Use [git.config] for reflog cleaning up (#24958)\n   * Affects git.reflog config entries and we don' thave any.\n * Allow all URL schemes in Markdown links by default (#24805)\n   * TODO determine if we need to limit link types and add that\n     change if so. A point release was made to exclude bad types\n     already. Not sure if there are others we need to add.\n * Redesign Scoped Access Tokens (#24767)\n   * This breaks scoped tokens with scopes that don't exist anymore.\n     I don't think we use scoped tokens.\n * Fix team members API endpoint pagination (#24754)\n   * They 1 index the pagination of this endpoint now instead of 0\n     indexing it.\n * Rewrite logger system (#24726)\n   * They made changes to the loggers and encourage people to check\n     their logs work as expected when upgrading. Using our test instance\n     logs I don't see anything that is a problem.\n * Increase default LFS auth timeout from 20m to 24h (#24628)\n   * We don't LFS but can change the timeout if necssary.\n * Rewrite queue (#24505)\n   * Check for 'Removed queue option:' log entries and clean up\n     corresponding entries in app.ini. We don't have any of these\n     entries in our logs.\n * Remove unused setting time.FORMAT (#24430)\n   * We didn't have this entry in app.ini.\n * Refactor setting.Other and remove unused SHOW_FOOTER_BRANDING (#24270)\n   * This setting can be removed from app.ini, but we don't set it.\n * Correct the access log format (#24085)\n   * We uncorrect it because they removed source port info in the\n     correction step. They did this because some log parsers don't\n     understand having the port info present, but if you are behind a\n     reverse proxy this information is very important. We run gitea behind\n     a reverse proxy.\n * Reserve \".png\" suffix for user/org names (#23992)\n   * .png is no longer a valid user/org name (it didn't work before\n     anyway).\n * Prefer native parser for SSH public key parsing (#23798)\n   * If you relied on the openssh ssh-keygen executable for public key\n     parsing then you must explicitly set config to use it. I don't\n     think we do as the golang native parser should handle the keytypes\n     we use.\n * Editor preview support for external renderers (#23333)\n   * This removed an app.ini settings we don't seem to set.\n * Add Gitea Profile Readmes (#23260)\n   * Readmes in .profile repositories will always be shown now. We don't\n     have .profiles repos so this doesn't affect us.\n * Refactor ctx in templates (#23105)\n   * This affects custom templates as we may need to replace ctx with\n     ctxData in our templates.\n   * I've searched our templates for 'root', 'ctx', and 'ctxData' and\n     have found no instances. Looking at the files modifying by the\n     commits related to this change:\n     https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23105/commits/bd7f218dce01e0fb661b23b55995f5d51b4530e8\n     https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/23105/commits/7c01260e1df1dcb052e1cf86ebe982bf77c4407f\n     we don't seem to override the affected files. I think we are fine\n     as is.\n\nThe 1.20.1 changelog indicates there are no breaking changes, and git\ndiff shows no changes to the templates between 1.20.0 and 1.20.1.\n\nThe 1.20.2 changelog indicates there are no breaking changes, and git\ndiff shows no changes to the templates between 1.20.1 and 1.20.2.\n\nThe 1.20.3 changelog indicates there is a single breaking change:\n * Fix the wrong derive path (#26271) (#26318)\n   * If I'm reading the code correctly, I think the problem was storage\n     configuration inheriting the base storage config and particularly\n     the related path. Then when archival storage looked for its config\n     the path was the root gitea storage path and it would inadverdently\n     delete all repos when deleting a single repo or something like\n     that. We don't use these features and these are mirrors anyway so I\n     don't think this really affects us.\n\n[0] https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.20.3/CHANGELOG.md\n\nChange-Id: I265f0ad16c0e757a11c1d889996ffe2198625a1a\n",

Firstly the git client process\nsits on the cpu for a while, and then it spends a while statting files\ncorrespondong to the various objects.\n\nThis thinking takes much longer than is usually the case for `git\nclone' because the nova.git repo contains so many refs (>100K refs).\n\nI was only able to repro the problem on a somewhat overloaded VM, and\nonly with -q and redirecting output to files.  I conjecture that git\ndoes something slightly different if it wants to print progess info.\n\n(The practical problem for me is that this causes our git caching\nproxy to be unable to clone nova.git.)\n\nIn my tests, the slow system took 2 mins 48 seconds between being told\nthe last ref, and coming back to start asking for objects.

Before puppet 4 was announced, we rightfully feared\naccidentally upgrading to backwards-incompatible versions of these\npackages and breaking the world.\n\nNow we are completely off of puppet 2.7, so we don't need to keep any\nremnants of that around. Moreover, the new packaging system for puppet 4\nwill make it impossible to accidentally upgrade[1]. The package name has\nchanged from \"puppet\" to \"puppet-agent\", which has facter and hiera etc.\nbundled into the same package, and in order to get the new package we\nmust add a new \"puppet collections\" repository. So, not only is this\npinning logic not needed to keep us safe, it is also not going to be\nuseful when we upgrade to puppet 4.\n\nLooking at the puppetlabs repositories[2][3] we are already using the\nlatest version of the packages we are pinning and Puppet is definitely\nnot going to add new versions to these repositories.\n\nThe $puppet_version variable was leftover from when puppet.conf was\nmanaged by puppet and not ansible so this patch cleans that up as well.\n\n[1] https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.9/about_agent.html\n[2] http://apt.puppetlabs.com/dists/trusty/main\n[3] http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/7/products/x86_64/\n\nChange-Id: I06b5cd87ee7816b0f929d5e64dc66a5cceca222a\n",

With tarballs and releases moving to AFS\npublishing, we are going to want to track the release process more\ncarefully.\n\nInitially, I wanted to send timing statistics to graphite so we could\nbuild a dashboard and track the release times of all volumes.  Because\nthis requires an additional libraries and since we are deprecating\npuppet, further development there is unappealing and it would better\nlive in ansible.\n\nSince I6c96f89c6f113362e6085febca70d58176f678e7 we have the ability to\ncall \"vos release\" with \"-localauth\" permissions via ssh on\nmirror-update; this avoids various timeout issues (see the changelog\ncomment there for more details).  So we do not need to run this script\ndirectly on the afsdb server.\n\nWe are alreadying publishing mirror update logs from mirror-update,\nand it would be good to also publish these release logs so anyone can\nsee if there are problems.\n\nAll this points to mirror-update.opendev.org being a good future home\nfor this script.\n\nThe script has been refactored some to\n\n - have a no-op mode\n - send timing stats for each volume release\n - call \"vos release\" via the ssh mecahnism we created\n - use an advisory lock to avoid running over itself\n\nIt runs from a virtualenv and it's logs are published via the same\nmechanism as the mirror logs (slightly misnamed now).\n\nNote this script is currently a no-op to test the deployment, running\nand log publishing.  A follow-up will disable the old job and make\nthis active.\n\nChange-Id: I62ae941e70c7d58e00bc663a50d52e79dfa5a684\n",

This results in a nil value erb side which we can test against\nmore simply.\n\nChange-Id: I8016b7ab20843a6e35002bed1a79867480ddbd08\n",
