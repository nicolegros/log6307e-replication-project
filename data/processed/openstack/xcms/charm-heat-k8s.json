The heat-engines of both\nheat-api and heat-api-cfn are used for handling\nboth heat-api and heat-api-cfn stacks as the AMQP\ntopic is same and not configurable.\n\nAdd a new interface heat-shared-config to share\nthe auth encryption key between heat-api and\nheat-api-cfn.\nheat-api update the relation data with auth\nencryption key once the key is generated or\nany new relations are connected via heat-shared-config.\nSave the auth encryption key as juju secret\ninstead of plain text and grant access to\npeer and units connected via heat-shared-interface.\n\nCloses-Bug: #2036890\nChange-Id: I2ec7f03b5c64d87585141e15b20b01172b14ecc4\n",
