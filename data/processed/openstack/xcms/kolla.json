If\nenable_central_logging is set to true after deployment then the Heka\ncontainer needs to be recreated (for Heka to get the new\nconfiguration).\n\nThe Kibana configuration used property names that are deprecated in\nKibana 4.2. This is changed to use non-deprecated property names.\n\nPreviously logs read from files and from Syslog had a different Type\nin Heka. This is changed to always use \"log\" for the Type. In this\nway just one index instead of two is used in Elasticsearch, making\nthings easier to the user on the visualization side.\n\nThe HAProxy configuration is changed to add entries for Kibana.\nKibana server is now accessible via the internal VIP, and also via\nthe external VIP if there's one configured.\n\nThe HAProxy configuration is changed to add an entry for\nElasticsearch. So Elasticsearch is now accessible via the internal\nVIP. Heka uses that channel for communicating with Elasticsearch.\n\nNote that currently the Heka logs include \"Plugin\nelasticsearch_output\" errors when Heka starts. This occurs when Heka\nstarts processing logs while Elasticsearch is not yet started. These\nare transient errors that go away when Elasticsearch is ready. And\nwith buffering enabled on the ElasticSearchOuput plugin logs will be\nbuffered and then retransmitted when Elasticsearch is ready.\n\nChange-Id: I6ff7a4f0ad04c4c666e174693a35ff49914280bb\nImplements: blueprint central-logging-service\n",

The rabbitmq-server 3.7 packages\n  on packagecloud are not signed, which is why we have gpgcheck=0 for\n  that repo. Previously repo_gpgcheck was set to 1, but this breaks DNF\n  which does not seem to accept keys imported by rpm --import for\n  signing a repo (as opposed to packages). This causes it to prompt\n  during package install, which does not work without a terminal in the\n  build container. This should be temporary as we will upgrade RabbitMQ\n  to 3.8 soon.\n\n- Add InfluxDB repo back to list of repos to disable.\n\nChange-Id: Ibbb720390ff17e11249a5aa77163c15c0971209a\nPartially-Implements: blueprint centos-rhel-8\n",

The reasons for\nthis are as follows:\n1) Just like for I3e0e86026f5a4a78473bed824cd1682d3a020cd5\nwhen this nss module is triggered it tries to talk to dbus.\nIt triggers a bunch of selinux denials and it makes little sense\nto open all containers to talk to dbus.\nIn particular, if a container is run as non-privileged and bind-mounts\n/run from the host, we will hit selinux denials like the following:\n\n  type=USER_AVC msg=audit(1592337775.860:74119): pid=1284 uid=81 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:system_dbusd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 msg='avc:  denied  { send_msg } for msgtype=method_call interface=org.freedesktop.DBus member=Hello dest=org.freedesktop.DBus spid=406228 scontext=system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c162,c886 tcontext=system_u:system_r:system_dbusd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tclass=dbus permissive=0  exe=\"/usr/bin/dbus-daemon\" sauid=81 hostname=? addr=? terminal=?'UID=\"dbus\" AUID=\"unset\" SAUID=\"dbus\"\n\n2) It just makes little sense in a kolla-world to have containers\ntalk to dbus/systemd and it saves us some time when a lookup triggers\nthe systemd module for whatever reason. Especially because the\nnss-systemd module does a few things which are not useful in a container\n(ensures that the root and nobody users and groups remain resolvable,\nSystemD's DynamicUser= feature, provide Lookup API via Varlink)\n\nThe sed regex gives us the wanted results:\n$ diff -u /etc/nsswitch.conf.orig /etc/nsswitch.conf\n--- /etc/nsswitch.conf.orig     2020-06-19 07:18:10.974580755 +0000\n+++ /etc/nsswitch.conf  2020-06-19 07:20:12.260230103 +0000\n@@ -53,9 +53,9 @@\n # group:     db files\n\n # In order of likelihood of use to accelerate lookup.\n-passwd:      sss files systemd\n+passwd:      sss files\n shadow:     files sss\n-group:       sss files systemd\n+group:       sss files\n hosts:      files dns myhostname\n services:   files sss\n netgroup:   sss\n\nRelated-Bug: #1883849\n\nChange-Id: I81e5b7abf4571fece13a029e25911e9e4dece673\n",

It preserves the idempotency,\nimmutability and declarative properties of the containers.\n\nThe way this works in practice is that a data volume container is\ncreated.  Then when the containers start they use LVM to access\nthe filesystem where /var/lib/docker is contained.  Then the\ncontainer startup logic bindmounts the data volume stored on the\nhost filesystem in /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/ID.  This prevents\npeople with access to the host operating system from damaging\nthe contents of the data container.\n\nIt does mean that now we must use tools/stop to stop our containers\nrather than tools/cleanup-containers -f.\n\nThis is a containers best practice.  For more details see:\n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/\n\nBig credit goes to Danyeon Hansen for seeding this idea in the\nmariadb containers.\n\nNote occasionally docker-compose start/stop seems to not want to stop\na container.  This bug needs to be addressed upstream separately\nfrom our utilization of this best practice.\n\nChange-Id: Iaa1419f606e1b1b7a7560a095c49e79d643164f1\n",
