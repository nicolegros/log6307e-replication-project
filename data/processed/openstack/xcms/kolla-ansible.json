This is currently done using the packages\nat https://apt.dockerproject.org and https://yum.dockerproject.org.\nThese packages are outdated, with the most recent packages from May 2017\n- docker-engine-17.05.\n\nThe source for up to date docker packages is\nhttps://download.docker.com, which was introduced with the move to\nDocker Community Edition (CE) and Docker Enterprise Edition (EE).\n\nThis change adds support to bootstrap-servers for Docker CE for CentOS\nand Ubuntu.\n\nIt also adds a new variable, 'enable_docker_repo', which controls\nwhether a package repository for Docker will be enabled.\n\nIt also adds a new variable, 'docker_legacy_packages', which controls\nwhether the legacy packages at dockerproject.org will be used or the\nnewer packages at docker.com. The default value for this variable is\n'false', meaning to use Docker CE.\n\nUpgrading from docker-engine to docker-ce has been tested on CentOS 7.5\nand Ubuntu 16.04, by running 'kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers' with\n'docker_legacy_packages' set to 'false'. The upgrades were successful,\nbut result in all containers being stopped. For this reason, the\nbootstrap-servers command checks running containers prior to upgrading\npackages, and ensures they are running after the package upgrade is\ncomplete.\n\nAs mentioned in the release note, care should be taken when upgrading\nDocker with clustered services, which could lose quorum. To avoid this,\nuse --serial or --limit to apply the change in batches.\n\nChange-Id: I6dfd375c868870f8646ef1a8f02c70812e8f6271\nImplements: blueprint docker-ce\n",

If\nenable_central_logging is set to true after deployment then the Heka\ncontainer needs to be recreated (for Heka to get the new\nconfiguration).\n\nThe Kibana configuration used property names that are deprecated in\nKibana 4.2. This is changed to use non-deprecated property names.\n\nPreviously logs read from files and from Syslog had a different Type\nin Heka. This is changed to always use \"log\" for the Type. In this\nway just one index instead of two is used in Elasticsearch, making\nthings easier to the user on the visualization side.\n\nThe HAProxy configuration is changed to add entries for Kibana.\nKibana server is now accessible via the internal VIP, and also via\nthe external VIP if there's one configured.\n\nThe HAProxy configuration is changed to add an entry for\nElasticsearch. So Elasticsearch is now accessible via the internal\nVIP. Heka uses that channel for communicating with Elasticsearch.\n\nNote that currently the Heka logs include \"Plugin\nelasticsearch_output\" errors when Heka starts. This occurs when Heka\nstarts processing logs while Elasticsearch is not yet started. These\nare transient errors that go away when Elasticsearch is ready. And\nwith buffering enabled on the ElasticSearchOuput plugin logs will be\nbuffered and then retransmitted when Elasticsearch is ready.\n\nChange-Id: I6ff7a4f0ad04c4c666e174693a35ff49914280bb\nImplements: blueprint central-logging-service\n",

It preserves the idempotency,\nimmutability and declarative properties of the containers.\n\nThe way this works in practice is that a data volume container is\ncreated.  Then when the containers start they use LVM to access\nthe filesystem where /var/lib/docker is contained.  Then the\ncontainer startup logic bindmounts the data volume stored on the\nhost filesystem in /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/ID.  This prevents\npeople with access to the host operating system from damaging\nthe contents of the data container.\n\nIt does mean that now we must use tools/stop to stop our containers\nrather than tools/cleanup-containers -f.\n\nThis is a containers best practice.  For more details see:\n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/\n\nBig credit goes to Danyeon Hansen for seeding this idea in the\nmariadb containers.\n\nNote occasionally docker-compose start/stop seems to not want to stop\na container.

The database\ndata container does not support idempotency due to the fact that it\nexists instead of sleeps. Therefore each time `docker-compose up` is\ncalled, it will start the container and register a change. The\nmessage-broker does not have this issue and will remain unchanged even\nrepeatedly running these playbooks.\n\nDue to the use of a special branch of docker-compose provided by sdake,\nthis module requires at least docker-compose==1.2.0rc1\n\nChange-Id: If1644eaa3bff0c2a007fa2d479a95bea941945f6\n",
