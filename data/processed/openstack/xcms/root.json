By default, they are all disabled. However, if\nnecessary, they can be enabled and used in image builds based on Docker\nor LOCI.\n\nNote: This change is the prerequisite of [4].\n      The test plan with the `stx-openstackclients` image will be done\n      there.\n\n[1] https://opendev.org/starlingx/openstack-armada-app/src/branch/f/antelope/upstream/openstack/python-openstackclient/debian/stx-openstackclient.stable_docker_image#L26-L27\n[2] https://opendev.org/starlingx/openstack-armada-app/src/branch/f/antelope/upstream/openstack/python-cinderclient/debian/patches\n[3] https://opendev.org/starlingx/openstack-armada-app/src/branch/f/antelope/upstream/openstack/python-openstackclient/debian/patches\n[4] https://review.opendev.org/c/starlingx/openstack-armada-app/+/896462\n\nTest Plan:\nPASS - Build `stx-debian` base image\nPASS - Build all container images with --clean and confirm that:\n       1.

        "commit_message": "Migrate pike/master to stable/dev build streams\n\nThe use of pike/master naming when building StarlingX docker images\ndoes not properly reflect the differences in how images are built,\nresulting in some confusion for developers. Partly to address this,\nand to allow for independence between images, this is being migrated\nto use stable/dev build streams.\n\nThe stable build stream uses a base image (ie. stx-centos) that has\nsoftware repo configuration that points to StarlingX build output as a\nsource for software package installation. Images that use an upstream\nrepo as the main project code would generally use a stable branch for\nthis build stream, as well. For example, once Openstack Stein is\nreleased, the stable builds for StarlingX Openstack services will be\nupdated to build from a stable/stein branch.\n\nThe dev build stream uses only upstream sources for software\ninstallation, with images building from upstream master branches,\ngenerally.\n\nThe stx-libvirt image, for example, is built solely from StarlingX\nbuild output, and is therefore built in the stable build stream.\n\nAn image lineup for the stx-openstack application could therefore be a\nmixture of stable and dev build stream images. The \"stable\"\napplication lineup (once we have Stein) would be all stable build\nstream images, while the \"dev\" lineup would be dev build stream images\nplus stable images for any that are stable-only (such as stx-libvirt).\n\nTo roll out these changes without impacting designers or builds, the\npike/master builds will still be supported for a short period.\n\nThis update provides the tool and base configuration changes to\nsupport the introduction of the stable/dev build streams.\n\nChange-Id: Ib5dc9a7c1d8c37368d073e28d83eeb883766ee3f\nStory: 2005248\nTask: 30098\nSigned-off-by: Don Penney <don.penney@windriver.com>\n",
