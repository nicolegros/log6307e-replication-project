See the Go 1.12.12 milestone on our issue tracker for\ndetails.\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.12.12\n\nGolang 1.12.11 (CVE-2019-17596)\n-------------------------------\n\nfull diff: https://github.com/golang/go/compare/go1.12.10...go1.12.11\n\ngo1.12.11 (released 2019/10/17) includes security fixes to the crypto/dsa\npackage. See the Go 1.12.11 milestone on our issue tracker for details.\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.12.11\n\n    [security] Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 are released\n\n    Hi gophers,\n\n    We have just released Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 to address a recently reported\n    security issue. We recommend that all affected users update to one of these\n    releases (if you're not sure which, choose Go 1.13.2).\n\n    Invalid DSA public keys can cause a panic in dsa.Verify. In particular, using\n    crypto/x509.Verify on a crafted X.509 certificate chain can lead to a panic,\n    even if the certificates don't chain to a trusted root. The chain can be\n    delivered via a crypto/tls connection to a client, or to a server that accepts\n    and verifies client certificates. net/http clients can be made to crash by an\n    HTTPS server, while net/http servers that accept client certificates will\n    recover the panic and are unaffected.\n\n    Moreover, an application might crash invoking\n    crypto/x509.(*CertificateRequest).CheckSignature on an X.509 certificate\n    request, parsing a golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp Entity, or during a\n    golang.org/x/crypto/otr conversation. Finally, a golang.org/x/crypto/ssh client\n    can panic due to a malformed host key, while a server could panic if either\n    PublicKeyCallback accepts a malformed public key, or if IsUserAuthority accepts\n    a certificate with a malformed public key.\n\n    The issue is CVE-2019-17596 and Go issue golang.org/issue/34960.\n\n    Thanks to Daniel Mandragona for discovering and reporting this issue. We'd also\n    like to thank regilero for a previous disclosure of CVE-2019-16276.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sebastiaan van Stijn <github@gone.nl>\n(cherry picked from commit f741dc9c305fea900b96b8a838f959395799cf78)\nSigned-off-by: Sebastiaan van Stijn <github@gone.nl>",
