\section{Conclusion}
This project aimed at replicating the paper \textit{Source Code Properties of Defective Infrastructure as Code Scripts} by Rahman and Williams \cite{b1}. We replicated the repository mining as well as the approach described in the paper to answer two of the three research questions, \textit{RQ1} and \textit{RQ3}. We were able to replicate most of the results of the paper for \textit{RQ1}, being able to show what source code properties characterize defective infrastructure as code scripts. For \textit{RQ3}, our prediction models obtained very similar results as those obtained in the original paper. However, since the paper does not specify the different parameters for the model, it was difficult for us to come up with the same results. \\
Future work could be done to analyse why we obtained different results in more details as to provide insight into these discreptencies.
