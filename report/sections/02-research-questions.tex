\label{sec:research-questions}
This paper aims at answering two of the three research questions in the original paper, \textit{RQ1} and \textit{RQ3}, which are the following:
\subsection{RQ1: What source code properties characterize defective infrastructure as code scripts?}
For RQ1, we identified the code properties that characterize defective IaC scripts
using \emph{Mann-Whitney U} test and \emph{Cliff's Delta}. We didn't
compute the feature importance using a Random Forest since it was only mentionned
that we had to do the methods above in the replication guide. Unfortunately,
our computers missed computing power to complete the analysis for the Openstack
dataset.
\subsection{RQ3: How can we construct defect prediction models for
infrastructure as code scripts using the identified source code properties?}
For RQ3, we replicated \emph{3.5.1 Principle component analysis},
\emph{3.5.2 Statistical learners} and \emph{3.5.3 Evaluation methods}. It's good
to know that we didn't replicate \emph{3.5.4 Comparison model construction} since
we only did the analysis by properties and not by bag-of-words.

These questions will be answered using the approach described in Section \ref{sec:approach}.
