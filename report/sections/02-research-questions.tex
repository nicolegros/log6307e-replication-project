\subsection{RQ1: What source code properties characterize defective infrastructure as code scripts?}
For RQ1, we identified the code properties that characterize defecvive IaC scripts
using \emph{Mann-Whitney U} test and \emph{Cliff's Delta}. We didn't 
compute the feature importance using a Random Forest since it was only mentionned 
that we had to do the methods above in the replication guide. Unfortunately, 
our computers missed computing power to complete the analysis for the Openstack 
dataset.
\subsection{RQ3: How can we construct defect prediction models for 
infrastructure as code scripts using the identified source code properties?}
For RQ3, we replicated \emph{3.5.1 Principle component analysis},  
\emph{3.5.2 Statistical learners} and \emph{3.5.3 Evaluation methods}. It's good 
to know that we didn't replicate \emph{3.5.4 Comparison model construction} since 
we only did the analysis by properties and not by bag-of-words.
