\section{Research questions}
This paper aims at answering two of the three research questions in the original paper, \textit{RQ1} and \textit{RQ3}, which are the following:
\subsection{RQ1: What source code properties characterize defective infrastructure as code scripts?}
\subsection{RQ3: How can we construct defect prediction models for
    infrastructure as code scripts using the identified source code properties?}

These questions will be answered using the approach described in section \textit{III}
